### 你好 Hi 😋

I am a small potato level data engineer who are enthusiastic on burning\
down warehouses and infrastructure. My number one goal is to trigger your pagerduty\
while making sure mine doesn't, such a lovely mate, am I.

My Code Journey:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant 8_yo_me
    participant current_me
    participant bad_uncle
    bad_uncle->>8_yo_me: i bought red alert 2, come play
    loop Sensor
        8_yo_me->>8_yo_me: is mama at home
    end
    Note right of 8_yo_me: am i gonna get whipped? <br/>don't care
    8_yo_me-->>bad_uncle: yay!
    bad_uncle->>8_yo_me: want to get better?
    bad_uncle-->>8_yo_me: game shark!
    8_yo_me-->>current_me: where coding starts
    current_me-->>8_yo_me: let's buy some bitcoin and not pizza
```

### My favourite quotes
1. 你全心全力做到的最好可能还不如我的随便搞搞
2. 有时候你不努力一下，就不知道什么叫绝望
