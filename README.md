## ä½ å¥½ Hi ðŸ˜‹

I am a small potato level data engineer who is enthusiastic on burning\
down warehouses and infrastructure. My number one goal is to trigger your pagerduty\
while making sure mine doesn't, such a lovely mate, am I.

## Projects/Explorations
### In-Progress Mode

## My Code Journey:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant 8_yo_me
    participant current_me
    participant bad_uncle
    bad_uncle->>8_yo_me: i bought red alert 2, come play
    loop Sensor
        8_yo_me->>8_yo_me: is mama at home
    end
    Note right of 8_yo_me: am i gonna get whipped? <br/>don't care
    8_yo_me-->>bad_uncle: yay!
    bad_uncle->>8_yo_me: want to get better?
    bad_uncle-->>8_yo_me: game shark!
    8_yo_me-->>current_me: where coding starts
